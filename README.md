# Potato Disease Image Classification using Transfer Learning

This is a deep learning project that aims to classify three types of potato diseases: early blight, healthy, and late blight. The model uses transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet50V2 network and was trained on the [Plant Disease dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease?resource=download) from Kaggle.
